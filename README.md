# Unpacking the Biology of Psychiatric Genetics using Cell Painting


Microscopy imaging is undergoing a revolution, with modern microscopes and robotics enabling the acquisition of hundreds of thousands of images rapidly, and modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques enabling the creation of signatures of cellular state from high content assays like Cell Painting. Concurrently, advances in reprogramming biology, such as the generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), have fundamentally changed our ability to dissect basic biological mechanisms with relevance to human disease. The neurosciences, driven by the limited access to human tissues, were among the earliest adopters of this technology. Today, there is a pressing need to bridge the gap between findings from large-scale genetic studies and actionable biology in fields such as psychiatric, neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease. However, despite this urgent need for a scaled approach to systematically catalogue cellular traits in neuronal cells, there is a scarcity of reliable methods to reproducibly measure neuronal phenotypes without user bias. Neuronal cells can display some of the most complex cellular morphologies in the human body, but so far the Cell Painting protocol has not been routinely established for profiling these cells. 

**Here, we propose to adapt the Cell Painting assay to interrogate traits in neuronal cells, and apply it to a cohort of 48 cell lines carrying the 22q11.2 deletion, a genetic variant strongly associated with psychiatric disease, to test the utility of neuronal Cell Painting in identifying disease relevant phenotypes in a high-throughput setting.** Our work will bring together groups at the Imaging Platform and the Stanley Center to create a new strategy that could be integrated into multiple existing platforms at the Broad to enable, for the first time, the scaled investigation of neuronal profiles. We anticipate that the workflows we will create will facilitate phenotypic screening of neurons at a scale that begins to match the transcriptional revolution, and constitute a key technology to help move from genetics to cellular phenotypes to actionable biology and mechanisms. Gaining insight into neuronal morphology in health and disease will illuminate previously unknown aspects of neuronal biology, enable the interrogation of the effect of the hundreds of genetic risk variants on cellular phenotypes, and greatly complement several existing technologies pioneered at the Broad Institute such as CRISPR screens, drug screens, optical profiling and in situ sequencing to catalyze unprecedented discoveries that link genes and perturbations to neuronal phenotypes.
