# Analyze images from NCP Pilots

- `0.sample-wells-to-analyze` samples wells from the single plate of `NCP_PILOT_1` 
- `1.analyze-wells-to-analyze` analyzes wells sampled from `0.sample-wells-to-analyze`

We stopped working on this plate of data because we weren't able to get satisfactory image analysis results to proceed further (see [caveats](https://github.com/broadinstitute/neuronal-cell-painting/issues/2#issuecomment-537194070))
